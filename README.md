The project focuses on understanding the disease's progression and genetic factors. It employs medical vocabularies like UMLS and ICD for classification and analyzes key genes associated with dementia, such as TREM2 and APP. The project also explores network medicine, examining gene interactions and their implications. Additionally, it looks at shared molecular mechanisms with other diseases and analyzes the proximity of various drugs to dementia treatment.
